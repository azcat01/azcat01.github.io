# CS50x Final Project - Kanji N5 Quiz

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/mhodlNxp1lo
#### Description:
This is a quiz website for students who want to test their skills on Kanji, one of the Japanese letters that most people struggle to learn. 

This website is made only with HTML, Javascript, and Bootstrap languages. 

There are still many things that can be developed. Still, as an amateur programmer and as someone who is also learning Japanese, this website is enough to help students who are learning Japanese, especially learning kanji.
